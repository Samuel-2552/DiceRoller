You can directly download the apk file and run it.
The apk file is uploaded in the repo.

Before you begin

In this codelab, you will add dice images to your existing Dice Roller Android app. Be sure to complete the earlier codelab on building the foundation of the Dice Roller app first.

Instead of displaying the value of the dice roll in a TextView, your app will display the appropriate dice image for the number of sides that was rolled. It will be a much more visual and enhanced user experience for your app.
